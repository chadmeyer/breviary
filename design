We want to design a modular method of typesetting an office, or ultimately
a book of offices.

There might be something as wide as a week, but we'll skip that for now.

There is a day.  A day can have multiple offices.  A day has a title (e.g. 
Fifth Sunday of Easter).  A day can have multiple offices.

An office has an hour/title (Office of Readings, Midday prayer, etc.)  It has
an introduction, a Hymn, Some psalms/canticles, a reading or readings with
responsories, A Gospel canticle, Intercessions, the Our Father, and prayer.

A hymn can have a text, and potential metadata.

Psalms and canticles have an antiphon, the psalm text (broken up into stanzas)
the gloria, and possible line markings.  The Gospel canticle is set like any
other canticle.

A reading has a citation, the text, and a responsory.

There are different kinds of responsories, at the major offices there is a verse
in two parts which is repeated, a second verse with the second part of the first
verse repeated, the first half of the Gloria and the first verse again.  In a
minor office, there are just two verses.  In the office of readings, there is 
a verse in two parts and then a second verse with the same second part as the
first.  Finally on special occasions, there is a single line said in place of
the responsory.

Intercessions have an introductory text, a response, and a series of
intercessions with two parts.

In nearly every case, a part is optional.  In some cases there might want to
be an "as in" note rather than the thing itself.  In many cases the things
could be set out differently (verbose instructions, single or repeated antiphon)
