Amazing Grace, How sweet the sound \\*
That saved a wretch like me \\*
I once was lost, but now am found \\*
Was blind but now I see


T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear \\*
And Grace, my fears relieved \\*
How precious did that grace appear \\*
The hour I first believed

	\side{Leader 2} O Lord, you once favored your land \\*
	\side{Side 2}and revived the fortunes of Jacob,\\*
you forgave the guilt of your people \\*
and covered all their sins.\\*
You averted all your rage, \\*
you calmed the heat of your anger.

	\side{Side 1}Revive us now, God, our helper! \\*
Put an end to your grievance against us.\\*
Will you be angry with us for ever, \\*
will your anger never cease?

	\side{Side 2} Will you not restore again our life \\*
that your people may rejoice in you?\\*
Let us see, O Lord, your mercy \\*
and give us your saving help.

	\side{Side 1} I will hear what the Lord God has to say, \\*
a voice that speaks of peace, \\*
peace for his people and his friends \\*
and those who turn to him in their hearts.\\*
His help is near for those who fear him \\*
and his glory will dwell in our land.

	\side{Side 2} Mercy and faithfulness have met; \\*
justice and peace have embraced.\\*
Faithfulness shall spring from the earth \\*
and justice look down from heaven.

	\side{Side 1} The Lord will make us prosper \\*
and our earth shall yield its fruit.\\*
Justice shall march before him \\*
and peace shall follow his steps.


\side{Side 2} Glory to the Father, and to the Son, \\*
