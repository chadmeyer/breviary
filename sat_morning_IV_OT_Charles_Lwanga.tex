\antiphon{Leader 1}{We do well to sing to your name, Most High, and proclaim your mercy at daybreak.}
\begin{verse}
\side{Leader 1} It is good to give thanks to the Lord,  \\*
\side{Side 1} to make music to your name, O Most High, \\*
to proclaim your love in the morning  \\*
and your truth in the watches of the night, \\*
on the ten-stringed lyre and the lute,  \\*
with the murmuring sound of the harp.

\side{Side 2} Your deeds, O Lord, have made me glad;  \\*
for the work of your hands I shout with joy. \\*
O Lord, how great are your works!  \\*
How deep are your designs! \\*
The foolish man cannot know this  \\*
and the fool cannot understand.

\side{Side 1} Though the wicked spring up like grass  \\*
and all who do evil thrive: \\*
they are doomed to be eternally destroyed.  \\*
But you, Lord, are eternally on high. \\*
See how your enemies perish;  \\*
all doers of evil are scattered.

\side{Side 2} To me you give the wild-ox's strength;  \\*
you anoint me with the purest oil. \\*
My eyes looked in triumph on my foes;  \\*
my ears heard gladly of their fall. \\*
The just will flourish like the palm-tree  \\*
and grow like a Lebanon cedar.

\side{Side 1} Planted in the house of the Lord,  \\*
they will flourish in the courts of our God, \\*
still bearing fruit when they are old,  \\*
still full of sap, still green, \\*
to proclaim that the Lord is just.  \\*
In him, my rock, there is no wrong \\*

\side{Side 2} Glory to the Father, and to the Son,  \\*
and to the Holy Spirit: \\*
\side{Side 2} as it was in the beginning, is now,  \\*
and will be for ever. Amen.

\side{Leader 2} I will take you away from among the nations, \\*
\side{Side 2} gather you from all the foreign lands, \\*
and bring you back to your own land.

\side{Side 1} I will sprinkle clean water upon you \\*
to cleanse you from all your impurities, \\*
and from all your idols I will cleanse you.

\side{Side 2} I will give you a new heart \\*
and place a new spirit within you, \\*
taking from your bodies your stony hearts \\*
and giving you natural hearts.

\side{Side 1} I will put my spirit within you \\*
and make you live by my statutes, \\*
careful to observe my decrees.

\side{Side 2} You shall live in the land I gave your fathers; \\*
you shall be my people, \\*
and I will be your God.

\side{Leader 1} How great is your name, O Lord our God, \\*
\side{Side 1} through all the earth!

\side{Side 2} Your majesty is praised above the heavens; \\*
on the lips of children and of babes \\*
you have found praise to foil your enemy, \\*
to silence the foe and the rebel.

\side{Side 1} When I see the heavens, the work of your hands, \\*
the moon and the stars which you arranged, \\*
what is man that you should keep him in mind, \\*
mortal man that you care for him?

\side{Side 2} Yet you have made him little less than a god; \\*
with glory and honor you crowned him, \\*
gave him power over the works of your hands, \\*
put all things under his feet.

\side{Side 1} All of them, sheep and cattle, \\*
yes, even the savage beasts, \\*
birds of the air, and fish \\*
that make their way through the waters.

\side{Side 2} How great is your name, O Lord our God \\*
through all the earth!

\begin{verse}
\rednote{(Make sign of cross)}\\
\side{All} Blessed \rednote{+} be the Lord, the God of Israel; \\*
he has come to his people and set them free.

He has raised up for us a mighty savior, \\*
born of the house of his servant David.

Through his holy prophets he promised of old \\*
  that he would save us from our enemies, \\*
  from the hands of all who hate us.

He promised to show mercy to our fathers \\*
and to remember his holy covenant.

This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham: \\*
to set us free from the hands of our enemies, \\*
free to worship him without fear, \\*
holy and righteous in his sight \\*
   all the days of our life.

You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High; \\*
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way, \\*
to give his people knowledge of salvation \\*
by the forgiveness of their sins.

In the tender compassion of our God \\*
the dawn from on high shall break upon us, \\*
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, \\*
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, \\*
and to the Holy Spirit: \\*
as it was in the beginning, is now, \\*
and will be for ever. Amen.
