\side{Leader 1} Sing a new song to the Lord, \\*
\side{Side 1} his praise in the assembly of the faithful. \\*
Let Israel rejoice in its maker, \\*
let Zion's sons exult in their king. \\*
Let them praise his name with dancing \\*
and make music with timbrel and harp.

\side{Side 2} For the Lord takes delight in his people. \\*
He crowns the poor with salvation. \\*
Let the faithful rejoice in their glory, \\*
shout for joy and take their rest. \\*
Let the praise of God be on their lips \\*
and a two-edged sword in their hand,

\side{Side 1} to deal out vengeance to the nations \\*
and punishment on all the peoples; \\*
to bind their kings in chains \\*
and their nobles in fetters of iron; \\*
to carry out the sentence pre-ordained; \\*
this honor is for all his faithful.

\side{Side 2} Glory to the Father, and to the Son, \\*
and to the Holy Spirit: \\*
\side{Side 1} as it was in the beginning, is now, \\*
and will be for ever. Amen.
