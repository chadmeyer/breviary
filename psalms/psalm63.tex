\side{Leader 1} O God, you are my God, for you I long; \\*
\side{Side 1} for you my soul is thirsting. \\*
My body pines for you \\*
like a dry, weary land without water. \\*
So I gaze on you in the sanctuary \\*
to see your strength and your glory.

\side{Side 2} For your love is better than life, \\*
my lips will speak your praise. \\*
So I will bless you all my life, \\*
in your name I will lift up my hands. \\*
My soul shall be filled as with a banquet, \\*
my mouth shall praise you with joy.

\side{Side 1} On my bed I remember you. \\*
On you I muse through the night \\*
for you have been my help; \\*
in the shadow of your wings I rejoice. \\*
My soul clings to you; \\*
your right hand holds me fast.

\side{Side 2} Glory to the Father, and to the Son,  \\*
and to the Holy Spirit: \\*
\side{Side 1} as it was in the beginning, is now,  \\*
and will be for ever. Amen.
