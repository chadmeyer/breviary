\side{Leader 1}How great is your name, O Lord our God, \\*
\side{Side 1}through all the earth!

\side{Side 2}Your majesty is praised above the heavens; \\*
on the lips of children and of babes\\*
you have found praise to foil your enemy, \\*
to silence the foe and the rebel.

\side{Side 1}When I see the heavens, the work of your hands, \\*
the moon and the stars which you arranged,\\*
what is man that you should keep him in mind, \\*
mortal man that you care for him?

\side{Side 2}Yet you have made him little less than a god; \\*
with glory and honor you crowned him,\\*
gave him power over the works of your hands, \\*
put all things under his feet.

\side{Side 1}All of them, sheep and cattle, \\*
yes, even the savage beasts,\\*
birds of the air, and fish \\*
that make their way through the waters.

\side{Side 2}How great is your name, O Lord our God \\*
through all the earth!

\side{Side 1}Glory to the Father, and to the Son, \\*
and to the Holy Spirit:\\*
\side{Side 2}as it was in the beginning, is now, \\*
and will be for ever. Amen.
