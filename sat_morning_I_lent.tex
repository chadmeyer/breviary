\begin{verse}
When I survey the wondrous cross \\*
on which the Prince of glory died, \\*
my richest gain I count but loss, \\*
and pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast \\*
save in the death of Christ, my God! \\*
All the vain things that charm me most, \\*
I sacrifice them through his blood.

See, from his head, his hands, his feet, \\*
sorrow and love flow mingled down. \\*
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, \\*
or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine, \\*
that were a present far too small. \\*
Love so amazing, so divine, \\*
demands my soul, my life, my all.

\side{Side 1} I will keep your commands. \\*
I call upon you, save me \\*
and I will do your will.

\side{Side 2} I rise before dawn and cry for help, \\*
I hope in your word.\\*
My eyes watch through the night \\*
to ponder your promise.

\side{Side 1} In your love hear my voice, O Lord; \\*
give me life by your decrees.\\*
Those who harm me unjustly draw near: \\*
they are far from your law.

\side{Side 2} But you, O Lord, are close:\\* 
your commands are truth.\\*
Long have I known that your will \\*
is established for ever.

\begin{verse}
\side{Leader 2} I will sing to the Lord, for he is gloriously triumphant; \\*
\side{Side 2} horse and chariot he has cast into the sea.

\side{Side 1} My strength and my courage is the Lord, \\*
and he has been my savior.\\*
He is my God, I praise him; \\*
the God of my father, I extol him.

\side{Side 2} The Lord is a warrior, \\*
Lord is his name!\\*
Pharaoh's chariots and army he hurled into the sea. \\*
At a breath of your anger the waters piled up,\\*
the flowing waters stood like a mound, \\*
the flood waters congealed in the midst of the sea.

\side{Side 1} The enemy boasted, ``I will pursue and overtake them; \\*
I will divide the spoils and have my fill of them; \\*
I will draw my sword; my hand shall despoil them!'' \\*
When your wind blew, the sea covered them; \\*
like lead they sank in the mighty waters.

\side{Side 2} Who is like to you among the gods, O Lord? \\*
Who is like to you, magnificent in holiness?\\*
O terrible in renown, worker of wonders, \\*
when you stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them!

\side{Side 1} In your mercy you led the people you redeemed; \\*
in your strength you guided them to your holy dwelling.

\side{Side 2} And you brought them in and planted them on the mountain of your inheritanceâ€” \\*
the place where you made your seat, O Lord,\\*
the sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands established. \\*
The Lord shall reign forever and ever.

\side{Side 1} Glory to the Father, and to the Son, \\*
and to the Holy Spirit: \\*
\side{Side 2} as it was in the beginning, is now, \\*
and will be for ever. Amen.

Wash yourselves clean!
Put away your misdeeds from before my eyes;
cease doing evil; learn to do good.
Make justice your aim; redress the wronged,
hear the orphan's plea, defend the widow.
Come now, let us set things right,

Though your sins be like scarlet,
they may become white as snow;
Though they be crimson red,
they may become white as wool.

\rednote{(Make sign of cross)}\\
\side{All} Blessed \rednote{+} be the Lord, the God of Israel; \\*
he has come to his people and set them free.

He has raised up for us a mighty savior, \\*
born of the house of his servant David.

Through his holy prophets he promised of old \\*
  that he would save us from our enemies, \\*
  from the hands of all who hate us.

He promised to show mercy to our fathers \\*
and to remember his holy covenant.

This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham: \\*
to set us free from the hands of our enemies, \\*
free to worship him without fear, \\*
holy and righteous in his sight \\*
   all the days of our life.

You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High; \\*
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way, \\*
to give his people knowledge of salvation \\*
by the forgiveness of their sins.

In the tender compassion of our God \\*
the dawn from on high shall break upon us, \\*
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, \\*
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, \\*
and to the Holy Spirit: \\*
as it was in the beginning, is now, \\*
and will be for ever. Amen.
